This is the project that i made while practcing and learning the unsupervised machine learning algorithm for clustering of data

In this project basically the image is read as input and it is segragated in clusters of similar shade of colors, hence the more the amount of clusters the more colors the image would have and vice or verse hence it could be used to decolorise an image or to compress the given image but making and leaving it in cool paint effect.
